# Bionic_Text_Markdown
Convert ordinary string of text into bionic text within markdown. Very easy to use.

Made for personal use at my blog here: [**Stoic Archer**](https://stoicarcher.substack.com/)

# How to use
1. Head to the [Jupyter Notebook file](https://github.com/NicoEssi/Bionic_Text_Markdown/blob/main/Bionic_Text_Markdown_Converter.ipynb) and press on the blue shiny button at the top that looks like this: ![Google Colab](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/84f0493939e0c4de4e6dbe113251b4bfb5353e57134ffd9fcab6b8714514d4d1/68747470733a2f2f636f6c61622e72657365617263682e676f6f676c652e636f6d2f6173736574732f636f6c61622d62616467652e737667).
2. Run the cell by pressing the white play button in the upper left corner.
3. When prompted, insert your arbitrary string of text.
4. Copy the output text and use as you wish!
5. **Optional**: if your editor does not support markdown, double click on the paragraph at the bottom and paste your markdown text. You'll see Colab converting it. Copy that text, and paste it wherever you wish.
